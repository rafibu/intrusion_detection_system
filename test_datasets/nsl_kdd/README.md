# Using the NSL-KDD Data set

To use the Jupyter Notebook for static testing, first the data set has to be downloaded from the original [UNB website](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/nsl.html).

The Tests only use the two files:

- KDDTrain+.txt
- KDDTest+.txt

Which have to be set in the same directory as the Notebook.
