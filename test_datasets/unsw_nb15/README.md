# Using the UNSW NB15 Data set

To use the Jupyter Notebook for static testing, first the data set has to be downloaded from the original [UNSW website](https://research.unsw.edu.au/projects/unsw-nb15-dataset).

The Tests only use the two files:

- UNSW_NB15_training-set.csv
- UNSW_NB15_testing-set.csv

Which have to be set in the same directory as the Notebook.
