# Using the CIC-FLOW Data set

To use the Jupyter Notebook for static testing, first the data set has to be downloaded from the original [UNB Website](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2018.html).

The Tests only use the processed files, found in the folder 'Processed Traffic Data for ML Algorithms':

- Thursday-22-02-2018_TrafficForML_CICFlowMeter.csv
- Wednesday-14-02-2018_TrafficForML_CICFlowMeter.csv
- Wednesday-21-02-2018_TrafficForML_CICFlowMeter.csv
- Wednesday-28-02-2018_TrafficForML_CICFlowMeter.csv
- Friday-02-03-2018_TrafficForML_CICFlowMeter.csv
- Friday-16-02-2018_TrafficForML_CICFlowMeter.csv
- Friday-23-02-2018_TrafficForML_CICFlowMeter.csv
- Thursday-01-03-2018_TrafficForML_CICFlowMeter.csv
- Thursday-15-02-2018_TrafficForML_CICFlowMeter.csv

All files need to be in the same directory as the Notebook.
