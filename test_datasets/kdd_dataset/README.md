# Using the KDD-99 Data set

To use the Jupyter Notebook for static testing, first the data set has to be downloaded from the [Datahub](https://datahub.io/machine-learning/kddcup99).

The Tests only use the two files:

- kddcup.data_10_percent_corrected
- kddcup.data/kddcup.data

The first being in the same directory as the Notebook, and the second in a subfolder.
